## About me:

<p>I am a postdoc at MIT CSAIL, where I work with <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html">Russ Tedrake</a>. Previously, I received an M.S. and Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan in 2019 and 2022, respectively, where I was advised by <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/">Necmiye Ozay</a> and <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dmitryb/">Dmitry Berenson</a>. Prior to that, I earned dual B.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 2017, where I worked with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tomlin/">Claire Tomlin</a> and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anca/">Anca Dragan</a>. I'm a recipient of the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) fellowship and a 2022 R:SS Pioneer.</p>

## Research focus:
<p>My research focuses on developing general-purpose algorithms which can enable safe and reliable robot autonomy in the face of uncertainty. To design these algorithms and to prove their properties, my work unifies and contributes to methods in control theory, machine learning, motion planning, optimization, and formal verification. I am also interested in applying my algorithms to practical systems in order to solve robotic manipulation and navigation tasks. Please see <a href="projects/">this page</a> for an overview of my research directions, and <a href="publications/">this page</a> for a complete list of publications. </p>
